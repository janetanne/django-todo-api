# django-todo-api üìù
A simple To Do API built with Django and djangorestframework. 

This API utilizes ModelViewSet, which abstracts away the method handlers and provides operations or actions instead. URL routing is handled by DefaultRouter. TRULY MAGIC. 

I chose Django specifically because it was incredibly easy to get started (opinionated framework, batteries included), and djangorestframework made it extra easy to create the API.

```

Create and activate a virtual environment.
```
$ python -m venv .env

```

Install the dependencies:
```

Create a <kbd>secrets.sh</kbd> file that holds your Django secret key:
```

```

Source your key from <kbd>secrets.sh</kbd> into your virtual environment.
```
$ source secrets.sh

The server may recommend making the data migrations. If so, quit the server, and run this:

This was built with REST API best practices in mind.

### GET /todos
Returns all todos.

Response:
```
[
    {
        "id": integer,
        "description": string,
        "completed": boolean,
        "created_at": datetime,
        "updated_at": datetime
    },
]
```

### POST /todos
Creates a new todo and returns it. Completed property defaults to False.

Example request:
```
{
  "description":"Finish READme",
  "completed":false
}
```

Response:
```
{
    "id": 5,
    "description": "Finish READme",
    "completed": false,
    "created_at": "2021-03-24T21:39:28.692402Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-03-24T21:39:28.692439Z"
}
```

Error handling:

### PATCH /todos/:id
Updates a todo and returns it. Can change either the "description" or "completed" properties here; does not need both to update the todo.

Example request for todos/5:
```
{
  "completed":true
}
```

Response:
```
{
    "id": 5,
    "description": "Finish READme",
    "completed": true,
    "created_at": "2021-03-24T21:39:28.692402Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-03-24T21:47:13.522333Z"
}
```

Error handling:

### DELETE /todos/:id
Deletes todo and returns nothing. Successful response is HTTP 204 status code.
